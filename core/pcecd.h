// after a fresh fpga_program() before the core has reached its own loading-state
// setup. Exposed (with pcecd_is_mounted() below) so loadpce_dispatch() (pce.cpp) can
// clear stale CD state before running a HuCard -- PCE and PCE-CD now share one menu

// absolute CD-ROM sector number. The frame's own is_audio bit (2026-08-31g, real
// SECTOR_IS_AUDIO tag) selects which one main.cpp calls: pcecd_serve_sector() answers
